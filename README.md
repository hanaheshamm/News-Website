# News-Website

The motivation behind building the News Website was to create a user-friendly platform that enables individuals to stay informed about the latest news across various categories. In today's fast-paced world, having quick and easy access to reliable news sources is crucial. This project aimed to provide a convenient solution for users to browse and search for news articles according to their interests.


## Standout Features
The News Website stands out due to the following features:

* **Category Navigation:** Users can easily navigate between different news categories using the intuitive navigation menu, ensuring a seamless browsing experience.
* **Search Functionality:** The website offers a robust search feature that enables users to search for news articles based on specific keywords, allowing for quick access to relevant information.For easy search operations, users can simply press the ENTER key instead of clicking the search button. This allows for a more seamless and intuitive search experience.
* **Sorting Options:** Users have the flexibility to sort news articles by date published (newest first), relevancy to the search keyword, or popularity of the source, providing personalized content browsing.
*  **Read Full Articles:** To dive deeper into any news article, simply click on it. The News Website opens the selected article in a new tab, allowing users to access the full content without leaving the website. This feature enables seamless reading and provides a convenient way to explore the details and context of the news articles that pique their interest.

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* News API

## Key Learnings
During the development of this project, several key learnings were gained, including:

1) Understanding and integrating APIs: The project involved working with the News API to fetch news data and handle API requests effectively.
2) Front-end web development: Building the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provided valuable experience in creating responsive and visually appealing web pages.
3) Data manipulation and display: Processing and displaying news articles in a visually appealing grid format required data manipulation and understanding of DOM manipulation techniques.

## How to Use:

1) Clone the repository to your local machine using the command git clone https://github.com/hanaheshamm/News-Website.git.
2) Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3) Upon loading, the website will display the latest articles from the default category, which is set to "Egypt".

## Notes
* Please note that due to limitations of the API, search results may occasionally display articles that are not directly relevant to the search query. We strive to provide the most accurate and relevant results, but some variations may occur.

* Kindly wait for approximately 1 minute for the news content to fully reload. This ensures that you have the most up-to-date and comprehensive collection of news articles available for browsing.
